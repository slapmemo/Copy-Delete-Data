# ðŸš€ Copy and Delete Data ðŸš€
![](images/Software.png)
This Python application is a simple Tkinter program to copy specific lines from a text file and then delete those lines from the file. 
My personal use case is to automatically copy and delete a set of 5 lines containing account information from a text document and immediately post it as an ad. This way, I don't have to bother opening the text and dealing with it.
